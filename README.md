# Project Name :  Lending Club Case Study
The goal of this case study is to identify the driving factors behind loan defaults using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•The company faces two primary risks in loan approval decisions: loss of business and financial loss due to defaults.

•Identifying risky loan applicants (defaulters) is key to minimizing financial losses.

•Analyzing past loan data helps to uncover patterns that indicate a higher likelihood of default.

•The goal is to use EDA to identify driver variables behind loan defaults for better risk assessment and decision-making.

- The solution involves applying the following exploratory data analysis techniques:
    - Univariate analysis
    - Segmented univariate analysis
    - Bivariate analysis
    - Multivariate analysis
- The provided dataset is utilized to extract meaningful insights.

## Conclusions
Below are the businee insights generated for the give dataset using EDA

1.Higher interest rates on loans lead to a greater likelihood of defaults.

2.A lower annual income increases the chances of default.

3.The higher the group and sub-group (G and F), the greater the number of defaults.

4.Loans provided for small-scale businesses tend to have a higher number of defaulters.

5.An increase in the loan repayment term correlates with a higher rate of defaults.

6.Loans taken for debt consolidation and credit repayment are associated with higher default rates.

7.Borrowers who have defaulted in the past are more likely to default again.
